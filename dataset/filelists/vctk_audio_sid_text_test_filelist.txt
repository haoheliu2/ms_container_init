~/data/vctk/mfa/p229/p229_128.wav|67|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p234/p234_112.wav|3|That would be a serious problem.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p298/p298_125.wav|68|I asked why he had come.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p283/p283_318.wav|95|If not, he should go home.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p260/p260_046.wav|81|It is marvellous.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p281/p281_306.wav|36|These figures are truly awful.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p285/p285_247.wav|2|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p237/p237_180.wav|61|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p259/p259_052.wav|7|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p314/p314_053.wav|51|Rangers deserved to beat us.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p345/p345_070.wav|82|I haven't made any definite decisions.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p269/p269_132.wav|94|Who will attend?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p347/p347_295.wav|46|It is typical of me.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p251/p251_223.wav|9|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p300/p300_224.wav|102|There is nothing like this back home.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p276/p276_076.wav|106|He confirmed that the document was valid.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p294/p294_271.wav|104|I also thought, This is a feature film.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p259/p259_257.wav|7|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p248/p248_131.wav|99|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p334/p334_023.wav|38|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p345/p345_386.wav|82|It is quite simple.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p330/p330_382.wav|1|Neither was involved in violence.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p246/p246_133.wav|5|My daughter is an adult.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p257/p257_140.wav|105|It's not true.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p340/p340_011.wav|74|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p284/p284_409.wav|16|Then , he laughs.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p317/p317_129.wav|97|You would be wrong.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p279/p279_183.wav|25|Government will intervene.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p376/p376_273.wav|71|"If not, he should go home."
~/data/vctk/mfa/p233/p233_109.wav|84|It is not affected by the sale.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p234/p234_118.wav|3|When we looked at the company.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p336/p336_207.wav|98|The train was on time.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p227/p227_213.wav|29|What are you not good at ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p347/p347_113.wav|46|They are all Arabs.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p317/p317_125.wav|97|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p341/p341_031.wav|66|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p244/p244_338.wav|78|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p250/p250_288.wav|24|Is it in the right place ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p233/p233_156.wav|84|It opens the door to the Champions League.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p334/p334_118.wav|38|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p258/p258_027.wav|26|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p341/p341_187.wav|66|His signature is his handwriting.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p258/p258_347.wav|26|The composer will conduct.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p262/p262_005.wav|45|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p231/p231_174.wav|50|One season, they might do well.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p363/p363_285.wav|6|But he was far from alone.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p303/p303_113.wav|44|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p274/p274_181.wav|32|Is it in the right place ?)

~/data/vctk/mfa/p247/p247_065.wav|14|We will pay their bills.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p273/p273_105.wav|56|The pressure is on them.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p245/p245_167.wav|59|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p364/p364_239.wav|88|It was a long time coming.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p263/p263_047.wav|39|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p283/p283_333.wav|95|No final decision has been taken.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p335/p335_313.wav|49|The issues are very intense.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p280/p280_172.wav|52|He said some things which were better left alone.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p266/p266_006.wav|20|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p260/p260_027.wav|81|Is this accurate?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p326/p326_214.wav|28|It's not long enough.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p259/p259_253.wav|7|You are like an animal.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p228/p228_109.wav|57|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p376/p376_228.wav|71|"Half of young people had had contact with the police."
~/data/vctk/mfa/p361/p361_057.wav|79|That was something else.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p341/p341_058.wav|66|Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p363/p363_247.wav|6|We are taking no chances this time.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p262/p262_054.wav|45|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p238/p238_090.wav|37|He thought she was amazing.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p306/p306_020.wav|12|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p238/p238_339.wav|37|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p302/p302_285.wav|30|Others said they had been beaten by police.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p275/p275_377.wav|40|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p267/p267_286.wav|0|And they were being paid ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p243/p243_090.wav|53|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p274/p274_213.wav|32|It's easy to be negative about these things.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p286/p286_310.wav|63|But it has been an amazing experience.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p294/p294_293.wav|104|That case has still not been settled.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p273/p273_174.wav|56|Two years later, she was dead.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p231/p231_408.wav|50|I should think so, too.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p323/p323_084.wav|34|And, within itself, it is visionary.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p248/p248_025.wav|99|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p288/p288_197.wav|47|They are in the euro.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p300/p300_029.wav|102|Of course, this is nice to hear.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p299/p299_344.wav|58|He will never walk the streets again.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p376/p376_168.wav|71|"They will do their own thing."
~/data/vctk/mfa/p275/p275_277.wav|40|He looked very sharp.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p312/p312_022.wav|62|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p278/p278_093.wav|10|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p302/p302_312.wav|30|However, there was no hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p236/p236_368.wav|75|It was like a weekly wage.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p237/p237_056.wav|61|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p305/p305_162.wav|54|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p275/p275_018.wav|40|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p310/p310_039.wav|17|But one shouldn't go by that.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p299/p299_310.wav|58|Farmers have been an endangered species.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p259/p259_428.wav|7|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p339/p339_155.wav|18|It is just a matter of time.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p229/p229_347.wav|67|I've got no secret.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p256/p256_308.wav|90|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p360/p360_204.wav|60|It is dangerous and it is a lie.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p238/p238_208.wav|37|The refund is fully justified.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p341/p341_319.wav|66|This is very bad news.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p336/p336_399.wav|98|The pressure is enormous.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p229/p229_067.wav|67|That was the easy election.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p329/p329_159.wav|103|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p258/p258_304.wav|26|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p312/p312_033.wav|62|Haven't been so lucky since.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p266/p266_093.wav|20|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p307/p307_396.wav|22|It was early morning.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p326/p326_039.wav|28|There is nothing like this back home.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p333/p333_009.wav|64|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p295/p295_154.wav|92|I remember it clearly.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p297/p297_007.wav|42|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p233/p233_153.wav|84|It would be a last resort.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p244/p244_220.wav|78|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p267/p267_136.wav|0|It has become a way of life.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p311/p311_313.wav|4|The decision was left entirely to him.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p230/p230_113.wav|35|You can spend money on housing.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p318/p318_295.wav|19|We gave them the goal.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p236/p236_090.wav|75|After the match, do you ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p364/p364_156.wav|88|Ferguson had done his homework.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p310/p310_260.wav|17|That is my role.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p323/p323_261.wav|34|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p284/p284_393.wav|16|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p276/p276_460.wav|106|We will pay their bills.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p363/p363_273.wav|6|The plot is minimal.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p250/p250_039.wav|24|Costs have got to be controlled.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p317/p317_244.wav|97|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p280/p280_042.wav|52|He does not even trust his own members.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p227/p227_342.wav|29|Have a look at this lot.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p333/p333_255.wav|64|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p232/p232_103.wav|96|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p305/p305_138.wav|54|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p248/p248_196.wav|99|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p230/p230_166.wav|35|We believe in the medium term.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p303/p303_275.wav|44|There are lots of these women in Finland.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p280/p280_208.wav|52|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p330/p330_252.wav|1|I first met him last summer.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p330/p330_209.wav|1|I will not take you out of context.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p240/p240_214.wav|93|It had all been arranged.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p293/p293_185.wav|23|This is the stuff of live music.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p237/p237_230.wav|61|Clearly, the stakes are high.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p277/p277_014.wav|89|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p251/p251_107.wav|9|It had been played at festivals.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p302/p302_011.wav|30|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p264/p264_147.wav|65|She's been shot.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p236/p236_288.wav|75|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p323/p323_297.wav|34|I've got the shirt.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p297/p297_402.wav|42|I don't have a problem with getting older.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p267/p267_182.wav|0|A team is a team.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p226/p226_121.wav|43|Maybe this battle has been.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p311/p311_226.wav|4|Gone with them is any sense of narrative.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p335/p335_279.wav|49|Or rather he did and he didn't.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p270/p270_068.wav|8|Then followed a bout of flu.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p260/p260_072.wav|81|It was magic.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p362/p362_341.wav|15|The result could be all down to turnout.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p228/p228_180.wav|57|One season, they might do well.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p316/p316_152.wav|85|Failure is not an option.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p317/p317_423.wav|97|Manchester United are the classic example.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p243/p243_292.wav|53|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p362/p362_054.wav|15|We certainly hope we have been successful.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p243/p243_305.wav|53|What happened in that game ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p364/p364_297.wav|88|It was just one man.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p255/p255_049.wav|31|We were surprised to see the photograph.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p297/p297_358.wav|42|He said he had no reports of casualties.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p283/p283_430.wav|95|My aim is a top six finish.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p310/p310_300.wav|17|Mike Tyson went to prison.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p363/p363_051.wav|6|The nation has his music.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p261/p261_112.wav|100|It became a national network.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p234/p234_036.wav|3|It was sold at a loss.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p247/p247_470.wav|14|They were good years for him.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p303/p303_269.wav|44|After that nothing could save him.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p317/p317_256.wav|97|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p351/p351_161.wav|33|Paterson can afford to be generous.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p314/p314_295.wav|51|You take a risk.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p293/p293_268.wav|23|Our children are our future.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p306/p306_352.wav|12|Who has the second highest?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p273/p273_098.wav|56|The following are the principal provisions.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p285/p285_029.wav|2|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p266/p266_073.wav|20|It works for us.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p374/p374_288.wav|11|I had a good life at Rangers.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p280/p280_171.wav|52|You need a long-term strategy in football.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p239/p239_203.wav|48|It is all to do with the coaching.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p287/p287_292.wav|77|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p330/p330_112.wav|1|Wallace was in at the deep end.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p247/p247_141.wav|14|They made such decisions in London.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p277/p277_050.wav|89|This represents a tough game for us.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p233/p233_289.wav|84|He looked very sharp.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p284/p284_103.wav|16|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p334/p334_366.wav|38|We will miss him very much.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p238/p238_196.wav|37|Tiger is not the norm.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p304/p304_193.wav|72|Then they were awarded a penalty.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p229/p229_348.wav|67|Look at the witnesses.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p268/p268_147.wav|87|how do you get it back ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p293/p293_348.wav|23|He quit in October.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p341/p341_082.wav|66|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p258/p258_097.wav|26|It is a good lifestyle.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p340/p340_220.wav|74|Not so, it seems.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p269/p269_174.wav|94|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p270/p270_078.wav|8|I've had it for the exams.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p334/p334_224.wav|38|I can't blame the fans.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p307/p307_306.wav|22|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p361/p361_205.wav|79|Translation - we got it wrong.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p229/p229_142.wav|67|What will happen then ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p310/p310_221.wav|17|We will look into it.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p232/p232_357.wav|96|He had played well in that central role.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p263/p263_389.wav|39|This season has been a nightmare.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p283/p283_273.wav|95|Did he trip ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p374/p374_277.wav|11|Where do you start?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p301/p301_289.wav|91|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p345/p345_267.wav|82|Her presence was almost everywhere.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p264/p264_226.wav|65|No partners would lose their jobs.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p253/p253_050.wav|70|A neighbour said.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p276/p276_118.wav|106|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p295/p295_175.wav|92|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p247/p247_466.wav|14|I think it's a great system.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p301/p301_182.wav|91|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p294/p294_156.wav|104|We are well insured.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p287/p287_190.wav|77|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p258/p258_333.wav|26|Robert is a special talent.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p275/p275_122.wav|40|Who would have?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p231/p231_259.wav|50|It was the climax of the thing.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p330/p330_073.wav|1|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p277/p277_239.wav|89|I should think so, too.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p374/p374_352.wav|11|As if they ever stopped.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p244/p244_258.wav|78|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p277/p277_194.wav|89|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p241/p241_177.wav|86|The clarity is vital.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p247/p247_275.wav|14|What form did that take ?)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p230/p230_230.wav|35|That has been the easy part.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p323/p323_015.wav|34|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p269/p269_365.wav|94|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p310/p310_049.wav|17|They had four children together.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p281/p281_068.wav|36|I have proved that in the past.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p343/p343_162.wav|21|Dancing was her life.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p299/p299_208.wav|58|I'm a bit annoyed.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p329/p329_292.wav|103|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p232/p232_376.wav|96|He could make it.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p305/p305_135.wav|54|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p351/p351_231.wav|33|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p265/p265_153.wav|73|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p323/p323_137.wav|34|Everything was a dead end.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p305/p305_176.wav|54|That has given me great confidence.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p238/p238_053.wav|37|Does it matter ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p230/p230_195.wav|35|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p238/p238_093.wav|37|He seems to have everything.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p259/p259_323.wav|7|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p285/p285_032.wav|2|This is the window.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p302/p302_208.wav|30|Which means it matters.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p231/p231_176.wav|50|This much I can tell you.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p301/p301_054.wav|91|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p310/p310_102.wav|17|We shall rely on human beings.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p305/p305_121.wav|54|It is a vicious circle.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p231/p231_458.wav|50|She has reached the top of her profession.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p311/p311_024.wav|4|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p245/p245_248.wav|59|Is there on his hands?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p333/p333_311.wav|64|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p299/p299_007.wav|58|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p229/p229_333.wav|67|She did not attend the courtroom.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p307/p307_286.wav|22|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p305/p305_414.wav|54|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p264/p264_140.wav|65|He nearly killed my son.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p374/p374_114.wav|11|I don't think it would make any difference.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p363/p363_369.wav|6|We have been overwhelmed by the response.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p293/p293_374.wav|23|I don't think the referees are against us.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p316/p316_329.wav|85|It's a production company.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p236/p236_018.wav|75|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p234/p234_332.wav|3|But it can be done.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p277/p277_132.wav|89|No production was achieved.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p326/p326_205.wav|28|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p272/p272_134.wav|69|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p316/p316_125.wav|85|And now the pressure is off.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p274/p274_149.wav|32|I prefer the clarity of the existing system.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p227/p227_368.wav|29|A crucial moment has arrived.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p334/p334_206.wav|38|We'll have to work hard today.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p339/p339_087.wav|18|I am not completely insane.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p286/p286_453.wav|63|He was said to be emotionally disturbed.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p301/p301_110.wav|91|People want to see me on the screen.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p282/p282_188.wav|83|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p263/p263_147.wav|39|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p256/p256_253.wav|90|I was never going to play against Scotland.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p374/p374_165.wav|11|Something has got to change.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p262/p262_232.wav|45|It's very safe.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p267/p267_417.wav|0|This is no reflection on Rangers.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p240/p240_078.wav|93|I've got the shirt.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p347/p347_143.wav|46|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p245/p245_069.wav|59|She died in hospital two hours later.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p233/p233_172.wav|84|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p280/p280_282.wav|52|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p298/p298_364.wav|68|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p339/p339_240.wav|18|The teacher would have approved.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p361/p361_387.wav|79|We have been going for three years.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p278/p278_221.wav|10|January is a bad time of year.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p334/p334_289.wav|38|They married in August last year.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p250/p250_187.wav|24|This championship is different from the other majors.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p248/p248_283.wav|99|Maloney is an engaging talent.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p275/p275_261.wav|40|It will be done in stages.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p288/p288_024.wav|47|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p271/p271_454.wav|27|It's a miracle.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p252/p252_408.wav|55|They had to have hospital treatment.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p261/p261_192.wav|100|It was a pre-emptive strike.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p308/p308_099.wav|107|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p288/p288_070.wav|47|Neither it is.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p317/p317_356.wav|97|We're not an employment agency.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p351/p351_251.wav|33|That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p329/p329_075.wav|103|This will be no easy option.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p261/p261_180.wav|100|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p301/p301_272.wav|91|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p277/p277_404.wav|89|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p301/p301_135.wav|91|How good is Lennox Lewis?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p246/p246_333.wav|5|Two people were interviewed.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p340/p340_250.wav|74|The film was great.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p268/p268_355.wav|87|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p236/p236_143.wav|75|The whole industry is a shambles.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p231/p231_398.wav|50|They have failed to deliver.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p340/p340_322.wav|74|I am extremely cautious.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p228/p228_048.wav|57|The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p334/p334_193.wav|38|It is in our own hands.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p226/p226_128.wav|43|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p279/p279_064.wav|25|We have not given up hope.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p304/p304_416.wav|72|He took over our lives.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p313/p313_119.wav|76|O Neill is reputed to have replied.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p287/p287_195.wav|77|It comes from reflection or thinking.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p234/p234_008.wav|3|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p277/p277_119.wav|89|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p281/p281_394.wav|36|What are they for ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p287/p287_272.wav|77|And they were being paid ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p288/p288_071.wav|47|He seemed to lose his focus.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p335/p335_245.wav|49|A friendship that will endure.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p239/p239_061.wav|48|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p254/p254_003.wav|41|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p259/p259_282.wav|7|Washington is consumed by the crisis.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p253/p253_202.wav|70|Sadly, it can't.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p318/p318_333.wav|19|But when we do it is great.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p351/p351_363.wav|33|You will never forget the clutching horror.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p241/p241_374.wav|86|There is no signature.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p272/p272_216.wav|69|The report is due out next month.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p330/p330_355.wav|1|I've got my own ideas.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p270/p270_179.wav|8|The outcome is now in our own hands.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p257/p257_079.wav|105|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p257/p257_027.wav|105|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p279/p279_118.wav|25|Does this mean.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p334/p334_058.wav|38|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p363/p363_178.wav|6|That was a huge experience.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p376/p376_227.wav|71|"And thought we would get away with it."
~/data/vctk/mfa/p330/p330_411.wav|1|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p326/p326_316.wav|28|It certainly sounded it at times.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p323/p323_048.wav|34|Mackie was at home, unable to watch.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p313/p313_422.wav|76|Now, that is a good deal.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p364/p364_113.wav|88|It was just great.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p286/p286_414.wav|63|It's just a training thing.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p288/p288_229.wav|47|However, no further action was taken by police.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p259/p259_142.wav|7|What happened in that game ?)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p297/p297_118.wav|42|It's too big a risk to take.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p313/p313_209.wav|76|The night is young.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p303/p303_279.wav|44|I bought a car at auction.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p345/p345_166.wav|82|Miller was every bit as happy.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p333/p333_289.wav|64|It's going to be quite a challenge.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p336/p336_323.wav|98|One paper was not returned.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p271/p271_082.wav|27|He is in the queue.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p314/p314_175.wav|51|There is no substitute.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p248/p248_124.wav|99|I can't even get into the A team.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p297/p297_160.wav|42|Tax is a matter for national governments.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p236/p236_299.wav|75|how do you get it back ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p248/p248_300.wav|99|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p231/p231_429.wav|50|He is on the wrong side.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p250/p250_368.wav|24|We put our bid in last night.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p376/p376_191.wav|71|"I am totally surprised."
~/data/vctk/mfa/p250/p250_419.wav|24|She started to put on weight.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p239/p239_037.wav|48|He works at the airport.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p340/p340_165.wav|74|He was very fit.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p339/p339_258.wav|18|There are not too many like him.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p326/p326_266.wav|28|It may also be her last.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p231/p231_472.wav|50|He felt it was the right time.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p261/p261_411.wav|100|I had a fortunate war.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p272/p272_359.wav|69|Now, though, he has an incentive.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p340/p340_015.wav|74|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p283/p283_022.wav|95|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p281/p281_334.wav|36|However, the groups denied the claims.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p318/p318_223.wav|19|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p281/p281_039.wav|36|This film will be totally awesome.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p270/p270_013.wav|8|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p243/p243_047.wav|53|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p374/p374_122.wav|11|The course is in great condition.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p302/p302_040.wav|30|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p254/p254_231.wav|41|And thought we would get away with it.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p246/p246_222.wav|5|It's not before time.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p262/p262_044.wav|45|It is difficult for Ali.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p270/p270_005.wav|8|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p274/p274_340.wav|32|This is a historic occasion.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p329/p329_045.wav|103|I hope you will leave it at that.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p285/p285_188.wav|2|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p260/p260_193.wav|81|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p259/p259_371.wav|7|He was unable to come.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p275/p275_052.wav|40|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p233/p233_159.wav|84|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p277/p277_312.wav|89|It will work.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p295/p295_211.wav|92|Leaving the Labour Party is one thing.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p297/p297_150.wav|42|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p305/p305_026.wav|54|He added, however, that all options are under review.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p292/p292_121.wav|13|This would not be my first choice.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p253/p253_346.wav|70|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p363/p363_171.wav|6|He didn't know where to look.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p233/p233_128.wav|84|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p251/p251_137.wav|9|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p334/p334_034.wav|38|Appointed general secretary last September.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p286/p286_225.wav|63|This will take several weeks.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p363/p363_183.wav|6|Public safety is paramount.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p256/p256_207.wav|90|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p273/p273_311.wav|56|Job losses were also announced.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p274/p274_425.wav|32|The projections are very positive for South Africa.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p254/p254_065.wav|41|That's the day job.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p335/p335_123.wav|49|Wagner was never like this.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p258/p258_105.wav|26|We do not expect any surplus.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p286/p286_294.wav|63|It was an easy decision to come here.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p361/p361_218.wav|79|But we were wrong.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p247/p247_426.wav|14|Being captain of this club is fantastic.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p266/p266_391.wav|20|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p253/p253_116.wav|70|It is so sad.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p261/p261_081.wav|100|Our mother is very worried.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p268/p268_131.wav|87|But then they scored their fourth.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p229/p229_192.wav|67|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p275/p275_260.wav|40|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p313/p313_109.wav|76|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p347/p347_072.wav|46|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p298/p298_334.wav|68|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p271/p271_232.wav|27|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p283/p283_056.wav|95|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p255/p255_239.wav|31|It's the same as Glasgow.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p267/p267_244.wav|0|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p340/p340_403.wav|74|I had a ball today.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p230/p230_083.wav|35|It might change your life.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p299/p299_403.wav|58|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p343/p343_128.wav|21|Then came the crunch.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p297/p297_021.wav|42|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p298/p298_275.wav|68|There are lots of these women in Finland.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p347/p347_286.wav|46|It is just too long since the war.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p239/p239_445.wav|48|Either group is living in fantasy land.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p286/p286_003.wav|63|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p299/p299_082.wav|58|I still feel like a wee boy.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p306/p306_213.wav|12|It is like being a qualifier again.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p339/p339_305.wav|18|We know the goals will come.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p265/p265_274.wav|73|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p310/p310_382.wav|17|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p335/p335_403.wav|49|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p246/p246_330.wav|5|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p288/p288_386.wav|47|There is a solution, she believes.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p234/p234_019.wav|3|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p287/p287_408.wav|77|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p286/p286_249.wav|63|She will attend in July.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p251/p251_235.wav|9|I'd never seen a play about me.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p347/p347_291.wav|46|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p257/p257_058.wav|105|It is not great art.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p231/p231_471.wav|50|Dennis was not so sure.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p341/p341_107.wav|66|There was great support all round the route.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p264/p264_160.wav|65|It was clearly not a battle.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p252/p252_155.wav|55|I think, therefore I am ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p336/p336_264.wav|98|Ferguson must take the blame.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p274/p274_142.wav|32|The referee faces a massive job.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p303/p303_005.wav|44|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p233/p233_240.wav|84|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p333/p333_220.wav|64|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p285/p285_303.wav|2|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p277/p277_348.wav|89|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p311/p311_290.wav|4|I am not in denial.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p286/p286_316.wav|63|I am a retailer by nature.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p306/p306_119.wav|12|Completion is expected by October the following year.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p240/p240_028.wav|93|Is this accurate?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p238/p238_295.wav|37|It has been recorded twice.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p278/p278_049.wav|10|He will need that machine.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p351/p351_282.wav|33|We just wish they had done so before.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p267/p267_348.wav|0|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p312/p312_360.wav|62|And Scotland is no different.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p311/p311_324.wav|4|He pretended not to care.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p283/p283_389.wav|95|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p266/p266_079.wav|20|He is in the queue.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p274/p274_424.wav|32|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.)
~/data/vctk/mfa/p303/p303_169.wav|44|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p252/p252_237.wav|55|You know the type.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p323/p323_115.wav|34|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p361/p361_013.wav|79|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p333/p333_356.wav|64|Which he can do.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p241/p241_029.wav|86|However, the following year the cancer returned.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p248/p248_371.wav|99|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p260/p260_007.wav|81|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p287/p287_257.wav|77|The concerns are the same.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p263/p263_125.wav|39|It isn't a happy memory.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p277/p277_258.wav|89|Immediate action must be taken.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p363/p363_219.wav|6|It was important in training terms.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p269/p269_191.wav|94|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p262/p262_020.wav|45|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p273/p273_023.wav|56|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p278/p278_029.wav|10|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p310/p310_065.wav|17|I have had no social life at all.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p255/p255_352.wav|31|He's very explosive.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p376/p376_019.wav|71|"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. "
~/data/vctk/mfa/p263/p263_307.wav|39|Is there a waiting list ?
~/data/vctk/mfa/p249/p249_258.wav|80|They must play for each other.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p258/p258_111.wav|26|Maybe this battle has been.
~/data/vctk/mfa/p316/p316_129.wav|85|There can be no compromise on that demand.
